\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\numberline{}Abstract}
The main aim of the project is the management of the database of the pharmaceutical shop. This project is insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System. This is done by creating a database of the available medicines in the shop. The primary aim of pharmacy management system is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. The aim of this project is to develop software for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. We have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock.\\
\\
This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain it. The software used can generate reports, as per the user’s requirements. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier. Here, the admin who are handling the organization will be responsible to manage the record of the employee. Each employee will be given with a separate username and password. \\
\\
The aim of the project is to create an effective software to help the pharmacist to maintain the records of the medicines, handle user details, generate invoice, check and renew validity and provide a scope of communication between users by using inbuilt messaging system. Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. This pharmacy management system is user friendly. \\

\chapter{Introduction}
The project's primary objective is to streamline pharmaceutical shop database management through the development of a Pharmacy Management System. This system ensures precise medication tracking, bolstering safety and operational efficiency within the store. Our software enables effective stock control, report generation, and secure user access, facilitating seamless interaction between users via an integrated messaging system. It addresses the complex demands of pharmacy management, catering to both administrative and employee needs, offering a user-friendly solution for pharmaceutical establishments.
\section{Problem Definition} 
The problem at hand involves the need for an efficient software solution to aid pharmacists in effectively managing medication records, user information, invoice generation, validity checks, and fostering communication among users within a pharmacy unit. This challenge necessitates the development of a user-friendly Pharmacy Management System capable of handling intricate pharmacy operations and catering to administrative and employee requirements, ultimately enhancing overall pharmacy management.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}

\textbf{Conclusion} 
\begin{itemize}
 \item {Detailed information gathering has to be done. Without that, the purpose for using the software won't be satisfied properly.}
 \item {Implementing the software requires a change in business practices.}
 \item{Efficient organization of all knowledge and easy retrieval of information is possible.}
 \item{It leads to ease in functioning of business processes}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Future Scope} 
\begin{itemize}
 \item {In this project, we can also include Bar code using bar code reader which will detect the expiry date and other related information. }
 \item {Project can be made more robust by adding bio-metric verification. }
 \item{There is also scope to expand by implementing newer technologies like AI,cloud etc.}
\end{itemize}
